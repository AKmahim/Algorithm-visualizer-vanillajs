# Algorithm Visualizer

### Overview
The Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based application designed to demonstrate the working mechanisms of popular algorithms used in computer science and data structures. This project focuses on visualizing key algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The visualizer provides users with an interactive platform where they can observe step-by-step how these algorithms process data, making it easier to grasp the underlying concepts. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application helps students and learners of all levels understand algorithmic logic and flow through engaging visual representation.
